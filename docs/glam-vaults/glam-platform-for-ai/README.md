# GLAM Platform for AI

GLAM Vaults offer powerful fine-grained access control and risk management, making them ideal for Crypto and AI developers to create autonomous AI agents that can interact with onchain assets.&#x20;

## Security Matters

While AI agents are drastically transforming the world with their ability to automate processes and enhance decision-making, the security risks they pose cannot be overstated. As AI becomes more integrated into crypto trading and asset management, the potential for misuse, exploitation, or unintended consequences grows exponentially.

* **Prompt Injection**: Malicious actors can manipulate AI models by crafting deceptive inputs, leading to unintended or harmful behaviors. For example, in crypto trading, a compromised input could manipulate an AI to execute unfavorable trades, siphon funds, or reveal proprietary algorithms.
* **Private Key Exposure**: A single vulnerability in how private keys are stored or accessed could lead to catastrophic breaches, enabling unauthorized transactions or complete asset theft.
* **Autonomous Mistakes**: While automation is a key strength of AI, errors in decision-making or misinterpretation of market signals can result in significant financial losses. An AI agent acting autonomously without adequate safeguards might execute trades based on faulty data or misaligned objectives, compounding risks in fast-moving markets.

## Key Features of GLAM Vaults

* Fine-Grained Access Control: GLAM Vaults offer detailed permission settings, enabling developers to precisely define the resources an AI agent can access.
* Risk Management: A robust suite of risk management parameters empowers developers to establish guardrails that effectively regulate an AI agentâ€™s behavior.
* Protocol Integrations: Seamlessly integrates with leading protocols like Jupiter (swaps), Drift (perpetuals), liquid staking, and more.
* CLI and Docker Support: Provides ready-to-use infrastructure, streamlining the development and deployment of AI agents.
* AI Agent Framework Integrations: Supports popular agentic AI frameworks such as [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/), [Eliza](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza), and more, with additional frameworks on the way.

## Get Started

1. Create your GLAM vault at [https://gui.glam.systems/vault/create](https://gui.glam.systems/vault/create)
2. Grant you AI agent's pubkey permissions on [https://gui.glam.systems/vault/access](https://gui.glam.systems/vault/access)
   1. We strongly recommend only granting the minimal set of permissions needed, following the [Principle of Least Privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege)
