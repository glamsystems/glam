# GLAM CLI

A convenient way of interacting with the GLAM program.

**This tool is in development.** You'll need to modify the code in `cli/src/main.ts` to make it work.

## Setup

Create a `.env.local` file under the `cli/` directory:

```
ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL=<solana_rpc_url>
ANCHOR_WALLET=<your_wallet.json>
```

Run the cli:

```
pnpm run cli
```
